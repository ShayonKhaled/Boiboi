## Boiboi: A Bookcrossing Tracker

📚 Boiboi is a web app for tracking my bookcrossing activities.  
  
❓ If you're wondering what that is, bookcrossing is defined as "the practice of leaving a book in a public place to be picked up and then read by others, who then do likewise."  
  
👇 Basically, I purchase some books time to time for bookcrossing, put a label on them that contains the URL of this website along with some instructions and drop them at random places, hoping someone will actually make the effort to come here and let me know.
